Ice Age Moving Game.

For this game I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.

As far as problems go, I had one regarding managing the canvas, and using timing methods in JavaScript. 

In future I would like to add a different welkome screen, more animation in game,  and a lot of new levels with different levels of difficulty.
